# Data Source and Summary Description

## Data Source:

The dataset used for this project consists of profile data of individuals who are prospective applicants for credit card issuance. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/creditmWcardmWapprovalmWprediction).

## Data Summary Description:

The dataset contains profile information of individuals who are prospective applicants for credit card issuance, along with their current creditworthiness levels.

- Number of Records: 36,457 (post-join completion)
- Number of Columns: 20 (post-join completion)
- Number of Tables: 2

# ML Deployment Objectives

The objective of this machine learning (ML) deployment is twofold:

1. **Analysis of Credit Card Applicants' Data:**

   - Analyze data of consumers who wish to obtain credit cards.
   - Develop a decision-making model for determining the issuance of credit cards.

2. **Improvement of Credit Card Business Profitability:**
   - Identify individuals with poor creditworthiness to enhance the profitability of credit card business operations.

# Steps for ML Model Production with MLflow

## Practical Process:

1. **Data Processing:**

   - Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for model training.

2. **Model Learning with MLflow:**

   - Train machine learning models using MLflow, a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

3. **Model Evaluation with MLflow:**

   - Evaluate the trained models using MLflow to assess their performance.

4. **Model Selection and Registration with MLflow:**
   - Select the best-performing model and register it using MLflow for deployment and future reference.
